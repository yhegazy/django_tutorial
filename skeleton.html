Side Note::
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to build a skeleton website for any project. This can be expanded out to other types of platforms with the technology and coding used in this lesson. I'll be referencing locallibrary (projname) and catalog(appname) as examples throughout the documentation. Finally, the documentation does not include how to configure the web development server (webdev). This is written in mind for Linux. For windows, replace python3 with python
A website may consist of one or more sections (mainsite, blog, wiki, download, sandbox, etc). Django encourages you to develop these components as separate applications, which could then be re-used in different projects if desired.
Creating any project starts with this command:
django-admin startproject projname
This will create the following:
    projname/
        manage.py
        projname/
            __init__.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py


manage.py | command line utility that lets you interact w/this project in various ways 
__init__.py | An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python Package setting.py | settings/configuration for this project 
url.py | The URL declaration for this project; a "table of contents" of your Django-powered site 
wsgi.py | An entry-point for WSGI compatible web server to server your projects This tool creates a new folder and populates it with files for the different parts of the application
python3 manage.py startapp appname

Views should be stored in views.py, 
Model in models.py, 
tests in tests.py, 
admin site configuration in admin.py 
application registration in apps.py 

The updated project directory should look like this:
    projname/
        manage.py
        projname/
        appname/
            migrations/
            __init__.py
            admin.py
            apps.py
            models.py
            tests.py
            views.py


Migration folder is used to store "migration" - files that allow you to automatically update your DB as you modify your models.
__init__.py is an empty file created so that Django/Python will recognize it as a Python Package & all you to use its object within other parts of the project.
Registering the appname application
Applications are registered by adding them to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the project settings. Edit: projname/projname/settings.py and find the definition for the INSTALLED_APPS list and add a new line @ the end of the list:
 
    INSTALLED_APP = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'appname.apps.AppnameConfig',
    ]


Side Note
The 2nd appname after .apps. needs to start with a capital letter.
appname.apps.AppnameConfig
The new line specifies the application configuration object (appnameConfig) that was generated in projname/appname/apps.py during the application creation.
Specifying the database & other project settings
It makes sense to use the same database for development & production in order to avoid minor differences in behavior. Databases are configured in projname/projname/settings.py.
Settings.py is used for configuring a number of other settings such as TIME_ZONE
SECRET_KEY is used as part of Django's website security strategy
DEBUG enables debugging log to be displayed on error rather than HTTP status code responses. Setting it to FALSE disables it.
Hooking up the URL mapper
Websites created are done with URL mapper file (urls.py). They are managed through the URL patterns variable, which is a Python list of URLs. Each URL() function either associates a URL pattern to a specific view or with another list of URL pattern testing code. Edit: projname/projname/urls.py
    from django.conf.urls import include

    urlpatterns += [
        url(r'^appname/', include('appname.urls')),
    ]


If this library exists, just add include at the end of the list (comma separated). Next, reroute the root URL (127.0.0.1) to the appname url (127.0.0.1/appname). This takes on a special view function (RedirectView), which takes as its 1st argument the new relative URL to redirect to (/appname).
    From django.views.generic import RedirectView

    urlpatterns +=[
        url(r'^$', RedirectView.as_view(url='/appname', permanent=True)),
    ]


Django does not serve static files like CSS, JavaScript and images by default, but can be useful for webdev. To enable:
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns +=static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)


Side Note
This is separate from urlpattern = [admin]. Notice the +=. This demonstrates a separation of old & new code.There are a number of ways to extend the urlpatterns list. Another way:
    from django.conf.urls import url, include
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.views.generic import RedirectView
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static
 
    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        url(r'^appname/', include('appname.urls')),
        url(r'^$', RedirectView.as_view(url='/appname', permanent=True)),
    ] + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)


Finally, create a file inside your appname folder called urls.py and amend the following
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from . import views
    
    urlpatterns = [
    ]


At this point of the lesson, we have completed the skeleton project. The website doesn't do anything yet, but it is worth testing it.
Run a database migration. This updates our dB to include any models in our installed app. (Anytime the model updates, these lines need to run)

python3 manage.py makemigrations 
python3 manage.py migrate

makemigration creates, but does not apply the migration for all apps installed in the project
migrate applies the migration to the dB.

To run the devweb:
python3 manage.py runserver
This concludes Building Skeleton Project
