# Django Beginner's Tutorial

بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم

This is my take on how to build a simple django website. I am going to try to be as basic as possible regarding code in hopes in making it easier to understand. 

Table of Contents:

01. <a href="skeleton.html">Building a Skeleton Project</a>
02. Models
03. Creating an Admin Site
04. Creating a Home Page
05. Creating Generic Views
06. Session Framework
07. User Authentication and Permissions
08. Working with Forms
09. Creating Flatpages
